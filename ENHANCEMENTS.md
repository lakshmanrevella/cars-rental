# Enhancements

Below are few of the possible basic enhancemets that can be done :
- Handling asynchronous requests using multithreading
- Similar to [Cancellation Strategy](https://github.com/lakshmanrevella/cars-rental/blob/master/UNOCarsRental/src/com/rental/strategy/CancellationStrategy.java) there is scope for Pricing Strategy 
- RentalService can be modified based on distribution factor
            

    a) if only one instance need to be created, could re-define it as singleton

    b) currently multiple services are supported.

- Integrating logger at code-level
